I created a text narrator using Amazon Polly.

For this project I created an IAM role, a S3 Bucket and wrote Lambda function code.



AWS Services Used:

Amazon Polly: Converts text to life like speech with customizable features.

AWS Management Console: Manages accounts and configures Amazon Polly.

AWS IAM: Ensures secure access by managing user permissions.
